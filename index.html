                    <p>Working remotely has unlocked us in today’s world. But somewhere the education
                        system cannot rely on remote workings. To heal this situation and also to provide a
                        better solution for the existing Education System we propose our project where
                        teachers and students can experience a complete digital platform for daily college
                        activities. Our project is a Web portal where we provide remote Computer Labs, Web-
                        Scraped Quizzes, Discussion Zone, Virtual Class, LeaderBoard and complete analysis of
                        students past performance.</p> -->

                    <h2>1. To Digitalise Computer Labs :</h2> <br>
                        As in current scenarios, teachers conduct labs
                        and give programs to be performed. A small bunch of students usually performs
                        those activities and take print for the entire batch. We provide a better
                        solution for this by proposing a Hackerrank like platform for each student,
                        where teacher will create lab manual, set their own test cases on which
                        students will perform using Online Compilers. Here teachers do not have to
                        go on every desk in order to validate students' code.

                    <h2>2. To provide Quick Quizzes:</h2><br>
                        Currently teachers make google form for quizzes
                        doing copy-paste for each questions and answers which is a troublesome job and
                        takes time. Here we provide teachers the power of webscrapping using which
                        question and options will be pulled in one go and will make this task quick
                        and easy.

                        Students have Pre Lecture, In Lecture,
                        Post Lecture doubts but don’t get a better platform to ask, in class of 60
                        sometimes it is not addressed as well. And also only a single person handling
                        60 requests is tough. So we provide a better platform where students can
                        ask/post their doubts which will be addressed by anyone in class who knows be
                        it a teacher or student.

                         Due to the pandemic webinars are picking up pace.But
                        the problem lies is the each webinar information and the zoom link is
                        scattered in a cluttered whatsapp group.These messages are often missed
                        resulting in loss for the students and the intention to keep the wenbinars.As
                        a result this system has all the webinars at one go one click enroll.No messy
                        messages anymore

                        Considering this lockdown
                        conditions as well, marks for current semester were calculated based on
                        students past performance. This ‘past’ term is very important to assess
                        performance of any entity and that's why it should be maintained properly. For
                        this we provide a complete dashboard where students as well as teachers can
                        view a students performance on any casual basis. This performance will be
                        evaluated based on their first to last year scores.
